# NLP_proj
Generates inferred topics from Hindi text files.

This project provides a basic implementation for inferring topics from Hindi text files using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning. It employs a Naive Bayes classifier trained on a dataset of Hindi keywords across various topics like Sports, Politics, Literature, Music, and more.

# Key Features:
Multilingual NLP: Uses spaCy's multilingual model to process Hindi text by removing stop words and punctuation.  
Topic Classification: Utilizes a Naive Bayes classifier to infer the topic and display the top three topics based on probability.  
User-Friendly Interface: Includes a simple Tkinter-based file selection window for choosing Hindi text files, and displays results in a pop-up window.
